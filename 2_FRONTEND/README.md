For the following questions, you are given an HTML file (`2_FRONTEND/final_answer/index.html`) with an embedded link to a `data.js` file. This file contains a serialized list of “author” and “book” entities as javascript objects. This represents a JSON output from an external API. With the given list, complete the following requests:

### Task 1 
In `index.html`, render the serialized data from `data.js` as a table showing the book title, the author’s name, and the total count of sales made per book.

### Task 2
Add sorting functionality for each column in the table. When the user clicks on the column head, it would automatically sort the table based on that particular field.

### Notes
* You are free to use any front-end framework or library to accomplish the task, as long as you include them in the final_answer folder. 
* Final design is up to you, but we care more about the functionality of the output.
* Make sure that the data is not hardcoded into the final output. Assume that the data file is returned by an external API that could change its values anytime.
